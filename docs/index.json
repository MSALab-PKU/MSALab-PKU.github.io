However, one challenge remains as the fine-tuned model often overfits on smaller datasets. A symptom of this phenomenon is that irrelevant or misleading words in the sentence, which are easy to understand for human beings, can substantially degrade the performance of these fine-tuned BERT models. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called Self-Supervised Attention (SSA) to help facilitate this generalization challenge. Specifically, SSA automatically generates weak, token-level attention labels iteratively by probing the fine-tuned model from the previous iteration. We investigate two different ways of integrating SSA into BERT and propose a hybrid approach to combine their benefits. Empirically, through a variety of public datasets, we illustrate significant performance improvement using our SSA-enhanced BERT model.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Improving BERT With Self-Supervised Attention.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingliang Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, existing multilingual machine translation models face a severe challenge: imbalance. As a result, the translation performance of different languages in multilingual translation models are quite different. We argue that this imbalance problem stems from the different learning competencies of different languages. Therefore, we focus on balancing the learning competencies of different languages and propose ***C**ompetence-based **C**urriculum **L**earning for **M**ultilingual Machine Translation*, named CCL-M. Specifically, we firstly define two competencies to help schedule the high resource languages (HRLs) and the low resource languages: 1) *Self-evaluated Competence*, evaluating how well the language itself has been learned; and 2) *HRLs-evaluated Competence*, evaluating whether an LRL is ready to be learned according to *HRLs' Self-evaluated Competence*. Based on the above competencies, we utilize the proposed CCL-M algorithm to gradually add new languages into the training set in a curriculum learning manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel competenceaware dynamic balancing sampling strategy for better selecting training samples in multilingual training. Experimental results show that our approach has achieved a steady and significant performance gain compared to the previous state-of-the-art approach on the TED talks dataset.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Machine Translation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yujing Wang","Yaming Yang","Jiangang Bai","Mingliang Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
