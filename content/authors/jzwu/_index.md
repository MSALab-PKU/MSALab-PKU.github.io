# Biography

I am Jianzong Wu (吴健宗) and I am a PhD Student at School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Peking University (PKU), advised by Prof. Yunhai Tong. Previously, I obtained my bachelor’s degree at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

My research interest focuses on multi-modal learning, including feature alignment, scene understanding and content generation. So far, I have conducted research works on referring image segmentation, open vocabulary image segmentation, text-to-image editting task, multi-modal large language models, as well as several related fields.
