- Our group aims at exploring the state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal learning, visual perception, video content analysis, and language semantics analysis to advance the AI model's abilities to understand semantics behind various modal.

- Currently, we are focusing on three directions:

  - Multi-modal Large Language model.

  - Text2Image and Text2Video Generation and Editing. 

  - Large Language Model.
	

- Our group at Peking University is recruiting self-motivated research interns and P.h.D.s who have strong coding and mathematical abilities and great interest in **multi-modal**, **large language model**, **text-to video generation and editing**.
